# Learning Lens Blur Fields

This repository contains the official implementation of [Learning Lens Blur Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11535), published in IEEE TPAMI 2025. This work introduces a high-dimensional neural representation of blur—the lens blur field—and a practical method for acquiring it from real-world camera systems.
